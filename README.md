# RealTimeTaskSimApp
The goal of this project is to create an Android application that generates a visual schedule from a set of tasks which is entered by a user. The application will accept userâ€™s input of the parameters of tasks. The parameters can include period, execution time, deadline, priority, and etc, depending on the type of the scheduler. Three types of scheduling algorithms will be implemented: RMS, EDF, and LLF.
